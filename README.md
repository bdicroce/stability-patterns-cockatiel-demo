# stability-patterns-cockatiel-demo
This repository showcases a few examples (in TypeScript) that one can use with the excellent library Cockatiel in order to inject stability strategies in your Javascript/Node applications.

The official NPM page for Cockatiel is here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cockatiel?activeTab=readme

# How to run the examples
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `tsc --watch` in the same location where the `tsconfig.json` is located (root path)
3. The `index.js` file contains the different scenarios which you can comment/uncomment to run them. Once all files are compiled, they'll be outputed to the `dist` folder within at the root path. Go inside the `dist` folder, and simply run `node index.js` to run the program and see the output on the screen.
